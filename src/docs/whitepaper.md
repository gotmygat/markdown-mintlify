***

Solar Sentra is an advanced wallet tracking and analytics platform designed specifically for the Solana blockchain ecosystem. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, Solar Sentra provides real-time insights, predictive analytics, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities for blockchain wallets and transactions.

## Core Features

### Real-Time Tracking

Monitor wallet activity across the Solana network with sub-second latency. Our distributed infrastructure processes over 50,000 transactions per second, ensuring no activity goes unnoticed.

### AI-Driven Analytics

Our proprietary machine learning models analyze transaction patterns, identify anomalies, and provide actionable insights. The system learns from historical data to predict future wallet behavior with 94% accuracy.

### Multi-Wallet Management

Track unlimited wallets simultaneously through a unified dashboard. Support for all Solana Program Library (SPL) token standards, including fungible and non-fungible assets.

***

## Architecture Overview

Solar Sentra operates on a three-tier architecture:

**Layer 1: Data Ingestion**
Direct RPC node connections with fallback mechanisms to ensure 99.99% uptime.

**Layer 2: Processing Engine**
Distributed compute cluster running custom AI models for pattern recognition and anomaly detection.

**Layer 3: Application Interface**
RESTful API and WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming to client applications.

# Use Cases

## Code Generation

> AI-powered code generation for wallet analysis and automation

### Objective

Leverage AI to automatically generate analysis scripts and automation code based on wallet tracking data from Solar Sentra.

***

### Use Case Overview

Solar Sentra's AI module generates executable code for custom wallet analysis, risk assessment algorithms, and automated strategies. Simply describe what you need in plain language, and the system produces production-ready code.

***

### How It Works

1. **Input**: Describe analysis requirements in natural language
2. **Processing**: AI generates Python/TypeScript code
3. **Execution**: Code runs in secure sandbox with real wallet data
4. **Output**: Structured results and visualizations

***

### Example: Risk Score Calculator

```typescript
import { SolarSentra, AICodeGen } from '@solar-sentra/sdk';

const ai = new AICodeGen({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });

const { code } = await ai.generateCode({
  prompt: "Calculate risk score (0-100) based on transaction frequency and counterparty diversity",
  language: 'typescript'
});

// AI generates production-ready function
const riskScore = await code.execute({
  wallet: '7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU'
});

console.log(riskScore); // 67
```

***

### Security Features

All generated code executes in isolated sandboxes with:

* Memory limits (512MB default)
* Execution timeout (30s)
* No file system access
* Network restrictions

***

### Performance

| Metric               | Value     |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| Generation time      | 2-5 seconds |
| Success rate         | 96.3%     |
| Sandbox overhead     | sub-100ms |

**Info**: Generated code is audited by AI safety models before execution.
