Solar Sentra is an advanced wallet tracking and analytics platform designed specifically for the Solana blockchain ecosystem. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, Solar Sentra provides real-time insights, predictive analytics, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities for blockchain wallets and transactions.

## Core Features

### Real-Time Tracking

Monitor wallet activity across the Solana network with sub-second latency. Our distributed infrastructure processes over 50,000 transactions per second, ensuring no activity goes unnoticed.

### AI-Driven Analytics

Our proprietary machine learning models analyze transaction patterns, identify anomalies, and provide actionable insights. The system learns from historical data to predict future wallet behavior with 94% accuracy.

### Multi-Wallet Management

Track unlimited wallets simultaneously through a unified dashboard. Support for all Solana Program Library (SPL) token standards, including fungible and non-fungible assets.

## Architecture Overview

Solar Sentra operates on a three-tier architecture:

**Layer 1: Data Ingestion**
Direct RPC node connections with fallback mechanisms to ensure 99.99% uptime.

**Layer 2: Processing Engine**
Distributed compute cluster running custom AI models for pattern recognition and anomaly detection.

**Layer 3: Application Interface**
RESTful API and WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming to client applications.

## Security Model

Solar Sentra employs enterprise-grade security:

- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all data in transit, AES-256 for data at rest
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all API access and data queries
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant

**Important**: Solar Sentra operates in read-only mode and never requires private keys or wallet credentials.
